# Max Lane â€” Personal Summary & Interests  

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!  

This repository/README file serves as a brief introduction to who I am, and my general profile contains repositories that showcase my personal projects. On my profile, youâ€™ll find everything from independent builds to collaborations with friends and academic work. I recently reorganized and cleaned up my GitHub repositories, consolidating prior work into new, dedicated repos. Most projects have fresh initial commits, but reflect months of development and iteration.


If you canâ€™t find a repository for one of my resume-listed projects (such as **ExamCam** or my **Class Scheduling Project**), itâ€™s because those repositories are currently private due to sensitive code. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to learn more about them!  

Please take a look around, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

## ðŸ•º Personal Summary  

**Bio:**  
Iâ€™m an enthusiastic junior **Computer Science** major and an experienced team leader with a strong work ethic and a passion for creative problem-solving. I aim to apply my skills in software development, AI/data engineering, and mathematics to make a real-world impact while continuing to grow professionally. In short, I love using my technical expertise to solve meaningful, human-centered problems.  

**About Me:**  
I take great pride in communicating effectively with both computers and people. Iâ€™m energized by creativity and genuine human connection, and Iâ€™ve often been told that my enthusiasm inspires those around me. Iâ€™m a fast learner with a deep drive for self-improvement, always working to refine my skills and grow into my fullest potential. I believe in *working hard, playing hard,* and living a balanced, healthy lifestyle. I love cooking and make sure to exercise daily â€” both of which help me maintain focus and well-being. 

**Interests:**  
Iâ€™m passionate about **music** (I love all genres), **sports** (especially basketball and football), and the **outdoors** â€” running, swimming, hiking, and photographing fall leaves are some of my favorite pastimes. Iâ€™m also an avid reader; my all-time favorite book is *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, though lately Iâ€™ve been reading more self-improvement and psychology books. My favorite movie is *The Prestige*.
