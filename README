Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I'm using this repository to share a brief summary of my projects.

On my GitHub profile, you’ll find all of the work I’ve done — from personal projects to collaborations with friends and school-related work.

If you cannot find a a repository for a project that's listed on my Resume (mainly ExamCam and my Class Scheduling Project), that is because those repositories are currently private as they contain sensitive code that we don't want to make public yet. Reach out to me if you have specific questions regarding one of those!

Please feel free to look around, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
